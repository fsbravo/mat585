% IMAGES = APPLY_IMAGE_FUNCTIONS(IMAGES_RAW, DIM, CHANNEL_WEIGHT, CHANNEL_BLUR, CHANNEL_NORMALIZE, CHANNEL_MEAN_CENTER, RESIZE_IMAGE)
% applies several different preprocessing procedures to the images in IMAGES_RAW
% IMAGES_RAW is the array of images
% 
% IMAGES_RAW is an npixels x npixels x nimages array (for 2D grayscale images)
%    npixels x npixels x nchannels x nimages array (for 2D color images)
%    npixels x npixels x nstack x nimages array (for 3D grayscale images)
%    npixels x npixels x nchannels x nstack x nimages array (for 3D color images)
% 
% NPIXELS is resolution of the preprocessed images
% Images are assumed to be square, such that each preprocessed image will
% be NPIXELSxNPIXELS
%
% DIM is the dimension of each image
% DIM=2 means that the imgaes are each 2D
% DIM=3 means that the imgaes are 3-D z-stacks
% 
% CHANNEL_WEIGHT is a nchannel-long vector of weighting factors; each
% weighting factor should be between 0 and 1, where 0 means the channel
% does not contribute, and 1 means the channel is at its full strength
% 
% CHANNEL_BLUR is a nchannel-long vector of blurring factors; each
% weighting factor should be between 0 and 1, where 0 means no blurring and
% 1 means a blur radius which spans the entire image
% 
% CHANNEL_NORMALIZE is a nchannel-long Boolean vector which indicates which
% channels should be normalized; Contrast-limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization 
% via the adapthisteq function is applied to each channel where
% CHANNEL_NORMALIZE(i)=true
% 
% CHANNEL_MEAN_CENTER is a nchannel-long Boolean vector which indicates which
% channels should be used to mean-center the object in each image; 
% channels where CHANNEL_MEAN_CENTER(i)=true are used for edge-detection
% and mean-centering in the mean_center_image or mean_center_zstack
% functions
% 
% RESIZE_IMAGE is a Boolean variable which indicates whether the images
% should be resized; RESIZE_IMAGE=true means that each image is scale so
% that the object occupies 80% of the total image. 
% 
% IMAGES is the image set after processing
